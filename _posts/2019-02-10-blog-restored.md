On september 25 in 2018 the provider that hosted my blog, did an oops with a server which resulted in my blog being down for some time. My blog was powered by Wordpress and for a longer time I allready wanted to move that to something more secure. I really liked the way [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) worked, so the only problem was to dedicate some time to restore the previous weblog so I could export my postings and move them to a Jekyll based blog.

For now the text is fully restored, but I have still work to do on the layout and the images. If you find something that is missing or not working, please drop me an e-mail and I will try to fix it.
