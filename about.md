## Mosibi
The name is based on MSB (Most Significant Bit), a way of refering to a particular position in a group of bytes or bits. My real name is Richard Arends, born in '73 and living in the Netherland with my wife and our son.

## Profession and interests
I am a Linux/Unix systems engineer working for the company [SUE](http://sue.nl) in the Netherlands. If you want to know more about my professional career, my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/todo)

In my free time you can find me often reading about new stuff in the Open Source world of tinkering with my home automation.
